1. Click the first icon next to New Sprite, and choose a sprite from the library. Go to Animals and choose Butterfly1. It says “Costumes: 2” when you select it. If you prefer you can pick any other flying animal that has 2 costumes!

2. In the Sprites panel, click your sprite. Add the following script to your sprite:
    ![](ScratchBlocksA.png)

3. Click on the green flag and watch the wings flap!

4. Next add the following blocks:
    ![](ScratchBlocksA.png)

5. Click on the green flag now. That’s the animation complete! 

6. You’re just missing a background. Click on the Stage and select Backdrops. Click under New Backdrop, and either choose from the library (first icon) or draw your own (paintbrush). To delete a backdrop, click on the scissors and click the backdrop you want to delete.

7. Click on the Duplicate icon (next to scissors [SCREENSHOT] ) and click your sprite. Now there are two of them! Duplicate it as many times as you like.

8. To change a sprite’s costume, click on the sprite and go to the Costumes tab. Click the first icon under **New Costume** to add a costume from the library. Add two new costumes: you need two that are nearly the same to make the wings flap. 
    * To delete a costume, click on the scissors and click the costume you want to get rid of.

9. You can also draw your own! How about a bee instead of a butterfly? Select the paintbrush under New Costume.
Draw a bee (or whatever you like). Then click the Duplicate button and click the costume you just made. In the second costume, change the wings so they are in a different position.
